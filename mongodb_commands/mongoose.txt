Mongoose

A library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.

creates a connection between mongodb and nodejs application.

it is an ODM (object data modeling) library for mongodb and nodejs.


install mongoose using npm

create a new mongo folder and run npm init -y to create package.json file.

and run npm i mongoose to install mongoose in the project.

create a index.js file and write the following code to connect to mongodb using mongoose.
touch index.js

we can directly connect to mongodb using mongoose without starting mongodb shell
and directly connect to mongoose using javascript code.


run the index.js file using node command
node index.js
but it does not show any output if connection is successful.

after connecting to mongodb using mongoose mongodb waits for further commands to perform database operations like create, read, update, delete etc.

connect method of mongoose returns a promise
it is an asunchronous operation so they take some time to complete
do not run according to the code


Schema ---->

Schema defines the shape of the document within that collection. that is overall structure of the document.every document in a collection should follow the same structure defined by the schema.

example :

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    age: Number,
    email: String
});


Model --->

Model in mongoose is a class with which   we construct documents.

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

1st paramter is the singular name of the collection that will be created in the database.
Mongoose automatically looks for the plural, lowercased version of your model name. Thus,
for the example above, the model User is for the users collection in the database.
