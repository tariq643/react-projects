sudo brew services start mongodb-community@8.2.3

1. Start the MongoDB Service 
To manually start the MongoDB daemon (mongod) for the current session, run the following command:
bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
 
2. Check the Service Status
After starting the service, it's good practice to check its status to ensure it is running correctly. 
bash
sudo systemctl status mongod
You should see output indicating that the service is active (running). Press q to exit the status view. 

3. Enable MongoDB to Start on Boot 
If you want MongoDB to start automatically every time your Ubuntu server boots, use the enable command: 
bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod

4. Connect to MongoDB 
Once the service is running, you can connect to it using the MongoDB shell (mongosh) to interact with your databases: 
bash
mongosh





---> help command to print all commands avilable inside mongodb

---> show dbs to show all the databases.

---> quit to exit the mongodb
