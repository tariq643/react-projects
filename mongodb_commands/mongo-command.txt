sudo brew services start mongodb-community@8.2.3

1. Start the MongoDB Service 
To manually start the MongoDB daemon (mongod) for the current session, run the following command:
bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
 
2. Check the Service Status
After starting the service, it's good practice to check its status to ensure it is running correctly. 
bash
sudo systemctl status mongod
You should see output indicating that the service is active (running). Press q to exit the status view. 

3. Enable MongoDB to Start on Boot 
If you want MongoDB to start automatically every time your Ubuntu server boots, use the enable command: 
bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod

4. Connect to MongoDB 
Once the service is running, you can connect to it using the MongoDB shell (mongosh) to interact with your databases: 
bash
mongosh





---> help command to print all commands avilable inside mongodb

---> show dbs to show all the databases.

---> quit to exit the mongodb

mongodb is a javascript shell.

mongodb commands are similar to javascript commands.

all node commands are similar to mongodb commands/javascript commands.

the test when we start mongodb shell by default it connects to test database/temporary database.

use command is used to switch between databases or create a new database.
it creates a new database if it does not exist already.

a new database is created only when we insert some data into it.

db command is used to show the current database.

in mongodb data is inserted in bson format.

bson is binary representation of json format.

the problem with json format is it takes more space to store data
and it is text based format whereas bson is binary format and takes less space to store data
and faster to parse


even though we see data in json format in mongodb shell it is stored in bson format in the database.
