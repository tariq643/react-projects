React.js Questions

* Do you know what is Virtual DOM and Real DOM?
* Can you please tell me about the life cycle in ReactJS?
* What are pure components in ReactJS?
* Have you worked on class-based components or not?
* Do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?
    * Can we use `useState` in class-based components?
* What are states and props?
    * Why do we mainly focus on creating the state in ReactJS? Why don't we go for simply creating a variable and storing the data over there?
* What are hooks in React?
* Can we pass data from child to parent or not? If yes, how exactly does this work (explain with an example of a callback function)?
* Have you heard about `useReducer`? How is it different from `useState`?
    * How many parameters does `useReducer` hook take?
* Have you heard about Context API?
    * When do we prefer to use Context API and when do we prefer to use Redux?
    * Can we use both Context API and Redux in a single project?
* Tell me the whole structure of Redux – why we use it, what are its main pillars, and how we can achieve a global state.
* Have you heard about Single Source of Truth?
* Do you know about Redux Toolkit? How is it better than core Redux?
    * What are the main features of Redux Toolkit that make it easier to write less code?
* What is the main use of `useDispatch` and `useSelector`?
* Scenario: You have a product listing page that calls a GET API automatically when the page loads to display a list of products. In which function or hook are you going to dispatch that action?
    * What does it mean to use an empty dependency array in `useEffect`?
* Scenario: You have a count state with an initial value of zero. There is a button that increments the count by one on click. Once the count value becomes five, you have to call a specific function (e.g., an alert function) without using an `if-else` condition directly in the `onClick` handler. How can you achieve this?
    * Can we achieve this using `useEffect`?
* Have you heard about middleware in React? What does it mean and how can we achieve it?
* How will you call an API in Redux (specifically with Redux Toolkit)?
    * Where are you going to define your functions (reducers or extra reducers)?
* What are lazy loading and code splitting?
* What are React Portals?
* What are Profilers?
* What are Render Props?
* Is it good to use prop drilling or not in a small-scale project?
* In React, do you know about pure functions?
* Where do we have to use the `useRef` hook?
    * Can we achieve the same scenario (focusing an input field on page load) without using `useRef`?
* Tell me the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
* Can we put our hooks in a variable?
